# what am I looking at?
This is a package for GNU Emacs that automates the thing you're never supposed
to do: Rebind the C-c prefix to a different key.

# how do I use it?
1. Just set the following customizable variables:
   - swap-c-c-new-key is the new key to put your C-c map onto
   - swap-c-c-new-binding is the new command to attach to C-c itself
2. Then activate swap-c-c-mode in the normal way (see internal documentation).
